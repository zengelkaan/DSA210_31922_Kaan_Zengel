    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to explore the factors influencing football team performance in the Premier League 2023-2024 season. By analyzing official team statistics such as squad value, age, possession, and defensive metrics, we attempt to determine which variables significantly impact the total number of points a team earns. Using data science tools, statistical hypothesis testing, and machine learning models, the study provides insights into how different metrics affect outcomes and whether predictive models can estimate a team's success.\n",

    "## WHAT DID I DO?\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a dataset containing statistics from all Premier League teams in the 2023-2024 season, I:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Preprocessed the data by engineering new features such as \"Conceded Per Match\" and \"Log Squad Value\"\n",
    "- Created visualizations to explore distributions and correlations\n",
    "- Performed Pearson correlation tests to identify statistically significant relationships with team performance (measured by Points)\n",
    "- Trained and evaluated 4 machine learning models: Linear Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost\n",
    "- Selected the best model based on R² score\n",
    "- Visualized actual vs predicted values for performance validation\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## KEY VARIABLES ANALYZED\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Log Squad Value:** Log-transformed market value of the team\n",
    "- **Foreign Player Ratio:** Proportion of non-local players in the team\n",
    "- **Conceded Per Match:** Goals conceded per match\n",
    "- **Goals Per Match:** Goals scored per match\n",
    "- **Goal Difference:** Difference between goals scored and conceded\n",
    "- **Possession Efficiency:** A composite metric of ball possession and effectiveness\n",
    "- **Squad Efficiency:** Performance relative to financial value\n",
    "- **Average Age:** Mean age of the players\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## HYPOTHESIS TESTING INSIGHTS\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Log Squad Value vs Points\n",
    "- **Correlation Coefficient:** 0.90\n",
    "- **P-value:** 0.0000 \n",
    "- **Interpretation:** Strong, statistically significant positive relationship. \n",
    "- → *\"When a team's Log Squad Value increases, their total points tend to increase as well.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Foreign Player Ratio vs Points\n",
    "- **Correlation Coefficient:** -0.19\n",
    "- **P-value:** 0.4178\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** No statistically significant relationship.\n",
    "- → *\"Having more or fewer foreign players does not appear to affect total points.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Conceded Per Match vs Points\n",
    "- **Correlation Coefficient:** -0.83\n",
    "- **P-value:** 0.0000\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** Strong, statistically significant negative relationship.\n",
    "- → *\"When teams concede more goals per match, their total points tend to decrease.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Possession Efficiency vs Points\n",
    "- **Correlation Coefficient:** -0.11\n",
    "- **P-value:** 0.6559\n",
    "- **Interpretation:** No significant relationship.\n",
    "- → *\"Possession alone does not guarantee better team performance.\"*\n",

    "## MACHINE LEARNING RESULTS\n",
    "\n",
    "Trained four models on 80% of the dataset and tested on 20%:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Model              | Mean Squared Error | R² Score |\n",
    "|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|\n",
    "| Linear Regression  | 111.78             | 0.85      |\n",
    "| Decision Tree      |  48.75              | 0.93    |\n",
    "| Random Forest      | 144.25              | 0.80       |\n",
    "| XGBoost            | 53.73               | 0.93      |\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Best Model:** *Decision Tree* with an R² score of *[0.93]*\n",
    "\n",
    "The model was able to effectively predict team points based on selected features. Actual vs predicted scatter plots were generated to validate model fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## INSIGHTS AND UNDERSTANDING\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strong predictors** of team performance include squad value and defensive strength (low goals conceded per match).\n",
    "- **Possession metrics** alone are not sufficient to explain performance.\n",
    "- **Foreign player ratio** and **average age** were not significant contributors to team success.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## LIMITATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset includes only one season, which may limit generalizability.\n",
    "- Player injuries, coach decisions, and other qualitative factors are not included.\n",
    "- Some derived metrics (like efficiency scores) may require more validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## CONCLUSION\n",
    "\n",
    "This project explored the quantitative foundations of football team performance using real-world data and data science techniques. By applying statistical analysis and predictive modeling, we identified key drivers of success and evaluated multiple ML models. The results emphasize the importance of team value and defense in determining success while highlighting that possession and player origin may not always matter. The project demonstrates the power of data-driven decision-making in sports analytics.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## NEXT STEPS\n",
    "\n",
    "- Expand the analysis across multiple seasons to ensure stability of results\n",
    "- Include player-level performance metrics for more granular insights\n",
    "- Incorporate advanced models such as Lasso Regression or Gradient Boosting with hyperparameter tuning\n",
